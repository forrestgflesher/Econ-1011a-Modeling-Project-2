# Econ-1011a-Modeling-Project-2
This is the second modeling project.  Please let me know when you make changes.  
The first part is easy, the second part looks pretty simple, but is important for the rest of the problem.
The third part seems pretty straightforward, but also pretty long.
The last part will be the most interesting/difficult part.

Would probably be good to include a few diagrams/pictures.  Of course a supply and demand graph would be good, 
but also maybe something for the other parts.
